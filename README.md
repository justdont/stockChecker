# stockChecker
A python program that allows you to check current stock prices<br />
Idea came to me when I cannot fall asleep<br />
Still a work in progress, right now, I only got it to check prices in the IDE right now, it will be able to check prices for both stock and cryptocurrency later on using command line. Maybe I will also add the graph feature, who knows.
