# stockChecker
A python program that allows you to check current stock prices<br />
Idea came to me when I cannot fall asleep<br />
Unfortunately, my experience with AlphaVantage did not go so well, I don't think the function I used was not meant for rapid requests, so it will throw off errors sometimes, just wait for a min before trying again.<br />
also I uses a mac so the sys command line might be different for windows.
